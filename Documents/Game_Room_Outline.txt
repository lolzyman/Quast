This is an outline for how rooms can get set up and organized. 

Each Room room has 3 different access ways to the adjoing rooms. For the Beta release, there will not be rooms of different size.

Inital Beta:
Rooms will have a 0/7 chance of being a dead end. 
Rooms will have a 4/7 chance of having two interconnections
Rooms will have a 2/7 chance of having three interconnections
Rooms will have a 1/7 change of being a cross roads.

These values can be played with to see what style of maps that they generate.
Seeds will be saved as values on a stack. The stack will allow maps to be generated predicatably.

During the initialization, older rooms take precedence and so rooms can be forced to have more or less connections than they want.
Rooms will follow a breatht first generation. Elements will generate them selves.
The will then check their surrondings to see if they need to modify their standing.
They will then check which connections need rendering, and then push those connections onto the queue.


Rooms can have three entryways on each side. If there isn't supposed to be a connection, then they just refuse any openings on their wall
If they have at least one open entryway, each with a 33% chance.
