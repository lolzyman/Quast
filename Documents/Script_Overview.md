# Quast Script Overview
This is an over view of the scripts used in the Quast Development. There might be overlap with the created files overview. The purpose of this overview is to have some sort of documentation.
[Test](Script_Source/test.md)


## [Admin Scripts](Script_Source/Admin_Scripts.md)
These scripts were originally created when the project had a focus on a multiplayer game. When it became clear that this wasn't the first steps to this game development, these were left unmaintained.

## [Game Entities](Script_Source/Game_Entities.md)
These scripts are for all in-game things. This includes scripts for handling charact, enemies and item functionality

## [MISC Controllers](Script_Source/Misc_Controllers.md)
These scripts are for the funcionalitity of things that don't necessarily have a visual presence in the game. This includes things like Inventory Management and Attack Controllers.
